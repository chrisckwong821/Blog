In the last article, I have managed to collected and saved the betting odds on the Hong Kong Jockery Club, using Splinter, a python light-weight scrapper leveraging on Selenium.

As scraping on local machine is highly unstable, it should be done on a remote machine. In this article I managed to implement the crawler over a remote Ubuntu machine through Digital Ocean. 

For your reference, I am using a Mac so most of my command is only applicable for Mac-user.



First, for the purpose of creating a basic remote virtual machine, I picked DigitalOcean(DO) because it is the most easiest way to start . For the most basic virtual machine, 20GB Ubuntu 16.04, 512MB Memory, $USD 5 per month. The price is comparable to Amazon Web Service(AWS) T2 Nano, but with no up-front cost or annual commitment. 

Moreover, DO is super easy to use and dont have to any configuration or download a SDK. This is a huge convenience. I have tried a few Clouds including Google Cloud(GC), Microsoft Azure(MSA), creating a virtual machine on DigitalOcean is by far the most effortless one in my experience.


Full Code Procedures:

    1. Initializes a machine(droplet) with python 3.5 pre-installed using the one-click app in DigitalOcean

    2. Connect to the machine through ssh built-in in Mac, type `ssh root@theipofvm`. Then type the password that would be sent to your email from DigitalOcean

    3. Install dependencies including Splinter(also Selenium implcitly), chromedriver for automated browsing, and chrome as a browser. 
    
    For Splinter: run **pip3 install Splinter**.

    For chromedriver run:

    - wget -N http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/$CHROME_DRIVER_VERSION/chromedriver_linux64.zip -P ~/
    - unzip ~/chromedriver_linux64.zip -d ~/
    - sudo mv -f ~/chromedriver /usr/local/share/
       
    For Chrome:
    - sudo apt-get install libxss1 libappindicator1 libindicator7
    - wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
    - sudo dpkg -i google-chrome*.deb

Then once all dependencies are settled:

    4. Copy the below code into a .py file, eg: jockery.py, it is basically the exact code over the last article, scraping betting odds from Jockery Club and save it to a csv:



```python
import re
import csv
import time
from splinter import Browser

pattern = '(rmid11[0-9]{4})'
matchtime, home, away = [], [] , []
odd_home, odd_draw, odd_away = [], [], []

browser = Browser('chrome',headless=True)
browser.visit('http://bet.hkjc.com/football/index.aspx?lang=en')
ids = re.findall(pattern, browser.html)
for match in ids:
    entry = browser.find_by_id(match).text
    regex = re.search(r'[\d]\s(.+)\svs\s(\D+)\s(.+)\n(\S+)\s(\S+)\s(\S+)', entry)
    home.append(regex.group(1))
    away.append(regex.group(2))
    matchtime.append(regex.group(3))
    odd_home.append(regex.group(4))
    odd_draw.append(regex.group(5))
    odd_away.append(regex.group(6))

date = [time.strftime("%Y/%m/%d")] * len(ids)
refresh = [browser.find_by_id('sRefreshTime').value] * len(ids)

rows = zip(matchtime,date,refresh,home,away,odd_home,odd_draw,odd_away)
with open('football.odds.csv','a') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    for row in rows:
        writer.writerow(row)
    f.close()

browser.quit()

```


    5. Check the path to python by typing **which python3**, copy the output. Now type **crontab -e** in terminal, type 
    * * * * * /pathtoyourpython /root/jockery.py into the editor.

    6. If the above does not work, type **$PATH**, copy and paste the output to crontab **PATH=theoutputofyourpath** before the previous cron command.

For improvement, instead of saving the data locally in the virtual machine, the data can be pushed immediately to some cloud storage. I would add an edit to it later.

Out of curiosity, I have browsed some web-based crawlers. Surprisingly, there are a bunch of them which are easy to use and have some threshold for free development.
So I guess this example is more for fun or proof of concept than what would be done in practice.
